# KasWare Wallet
Welcome to KasWare's Documentation.

KasWare is the first open source browser extension wallet for Kaspa in the world! Simple and reliable.

KasWare Wallet is a non-custodial wallet. We never have access to your funds. KasWare Wallet never stores your seed phrase, your password or any private information. Your accounts are derived from your Secret Recovery Phrase.

- KasWare Wallet is a hierarchical deterministic wallet. Your accounts are derived from your Secret Recovery Phrase.
- Your private keys are encrypted on your device by your password and are never shared with anyone.
- KasWare Wallet doesn't track any personal identifiable information, your account addresses, or asset balances.
- Users can import accounts from single private keys. These accounts are not derived from your Secret Recovery Phrase and will be labelled as “imported”.
## Quick Start
Click the [Download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hklhheigdmpoolooomdihmhlpjjdbklf) button, which will take you to the chrome store to download the extension. 
## Address Types
972 and 111111 are coin types (they are different for historical reasons)

KDX/Kaspanet Web Wallet uses m/44'/972/0' derivation path (with 12 word seed phrases)

The Core Golang cli wallet and Kaspium uses m/44'/111111'/0' (with 24 word seed phrases)

For KasWare Wallet users, we strongly suggest choosing 111111 coin type, which is the default coin type when creating a new wallet with KasWare Wallet.

**IMPORTANT** : KDX wallets are not BIP-32 compatible, so KDX derivation path is supported but is considered deprecated.
